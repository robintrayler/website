## Introduction
The Costech 4010 Elemental Analyzer combustion reactor needs to be changed periodically. The combustion reagents (chromium oxide and cobaltous oxide) will become exhausted and the Quartz glass reactor tube become etched and develops cracks over time, which can lead to a air leak. The reactor lifespan can vary considerably depending on the size, type, and number of samples being analyzed. At UC Merced the reactor is usually changed every 500 - 600 total analyses (including both samples and references). The reagents and reactor tube are **not reusable** and should be disposed of following university guidelines. 

## Packing a New Reactor
### Step 1
The Elemental Analyzer manual has packing diagrams for multiple reactor configurations. Almost all analyses in the Stable Isotope Ecology laboratory use the duel carbon and nitrogen configuration. 

### Step 2

## Changing the Reactor

### Step 1
Before you begin, make sure the elemental analyzer is in **standby** mode. If the elemental analyzer is in **work** mode use the main control panel to activate standby. From the main control panel press **st-by** and then press **enter** to confirm.

### Step 2
Since removing the combustion reactor opens the elemental analyzer up to atmosphere you ***MUST*** close all Conflo IV valves to protect the mass spectrometer filament. **FAILURE TO DO THIS MAY CAUSE SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE MASS SPECTROMETER.** Working in **Isodat Acquisition** navigate to the **Conflo IV Diagnosis** panel and toggle all green buttons off (they will turn grey) except `sample dilution 1`.
