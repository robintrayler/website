# About
I'm a paleoecologist and geochemist. My research focuses on the interaction between climate and ecology and has spanned geologic time from the Cambrian to present day. I use a variety of techniques including stable isotope geochemistry, geochronology, and Bayesian modeling. Currently I'm the Technical Director of the Stable Isotope Ecology Laboratory at the University of California, Merced.
